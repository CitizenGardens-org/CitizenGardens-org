Welcome to Citizen Gardens ~ Your Garden!

Citizens: Members of the same energy who take necessary action to multiply the welfare and reciprocity of their community.  

Garden: The realm of influence a member has in their capacity to utilize their resources and capabilities. 

Citizen Gardens is a Public Benefit Organization Exclusively Dedicated to All Humanity as a Social Investment Credit Union. Citizen Gardens exists as a prominent definition of Multiplicity, where as without it the definition would not exist. Citizen Gardens gives the least of us the ability to the become the greatest and it is a firm belief that everyone has something unique to offer and in that this platform defines, appreciates and rewards members for their participation. This is based on the concept that as a community we get discounts, deals, wholesale and whatever members bring to the table and we then turn over the benefits to the community and allow them to use various forms of credit to acquire what they need and want, 

In 2011 I transposed the struture and functions of an atom to that of a community, where the neutrons are buildings, cars, tools, etc... things that are inanimate without an operator, protons are the operators who carry out the necessary functions of the community and electrons are operators who interact in various ways and reptitions on the outside of the community. The formula of Multiplcity can be used to quanitify the reciprocity of any state of being from an individual to society as a whole. The law of Multiplicity is like the law of gravity, it has always existed we just haven't realized it but realized it equates a value that is non-dependent upon anything that is material, it equates the value of community. 

Multiplicity: In mathematics the multiplicity of a member of a multi-set is the number of times it appears in the multi-set. For example, the number of times a given polynomial equation has a root at a given point aka. prime factor.

Social: Relating to the interaction of members in a community.

Physics: The science that deals with matter, energy, motion, and force.

Social Physics: is a field of physics that studies society as an isolated system made up of a diversity of members with prime factors of reciprocity. It's primary focus being to appreciate the diversity of members and to identify what is held of most common value between them and the processes by which their arrangements are configured and how they change. It defines and appreciates various levels of interaction with an emphasis on the most crucial and beneficial interactions and their overall long term effects on the greater community.


Social Physics uses Multiplicity to distinguish levels of reciprocity between same energy members who only differ in their reciprocity angle and momentum.  It is defined as 2R+1, where R is their reciprocity momentum.

"Set" a system that equates all common value through a single medium based on the classification of it's highest energy.

"Multi-set" a system that equates common values through multiple mediums based on the classification of it's lowest energy.  

Citizen Gardens is a "multi-set" as it represents both the qualification of reciprocity between paired members and the quantification of the potential reciprocity of unpaired members.  Multiplicity is a result of Fredrick Hund's rule which favors the single filing of same energy members. The result is the filing of multiple members with a central reciprocity in multiplicity. Multiplicity, as defined in Social Physics, is calculated using the expression 2R+1, where R = Σmr or, more simply put, R = half the # of members. When a member is unpaired R=0, and their value of multiplicity is 2(0)+1=1. When a member is paired R =.5 and 2(.5)+1=2, two paired members R=1 resulting in 3, etc. This means that as members become pared their energy produces enough to provide for another. 

Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity
for a given state the lowest energy term is the one with the greatest value of multiplicity.

This implies that if two or more members of equal energy are available, reciprocity will occupy them singly before filing them in pairs. The rule, discovered by Friedrich Hund in 1925, is of important use in atomic chemistry, spectroscopy, and quantum chemistry, and is often abbreviated to Hund's rule, ignoring Hund's other two rules.

A function of Multiplicity in Social Physics is to identify prime factors of interaction, meaning interactions that don't overlap so there is no double counting. This is a list of known prime interactions, and I challenge you to think of more. 


1) Sharing: Referral, Word of Mouth, Invitation
2) Designation: Physical & Intellectual Property
3) Opportunity: Volunteer energy to help the community. 
4) Sponsorship: Donation of any physical monetary instrument.
5) Ingenuity: The speculation that something is risked in hope of gain.

The goal is to create a decentralized organization built on a scalable blockcahin with smart contracts to autonomously and transparently keep record of participation and to proof the functions of each form of credit.
